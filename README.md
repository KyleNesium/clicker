# clicker

Generic clicker. Initial build borrows _heavily_ from *cookieclicker*; once I've got the basic building blocks done, I'll make it more unique.

Roadmap:

* add upgrades
* abstract config into a theme file
* add fantasy theme

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
